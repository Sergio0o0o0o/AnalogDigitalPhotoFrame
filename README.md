# Over engineered analog-digital photo frame
An easy robotic way to go through your printed photos automatically

Thanks to a smartphone you can go through your photos instantly, everywhere and every time. Unfortunately, this makes us lose that unique feeling: print memories and make them last forever. Somebody could confute that this is just a way to store useless and bulky stuff, but I found the way to give a "new life" to tons of photos forgotten in the basement.

I uploaded all versions of my project because I would like to explain you the entire process from the idea itselfs.


Write me if you think you can help me or even just to ask questions about it. I will appreciate it.
